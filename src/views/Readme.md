# üìÅ views

This folder contains all the *view components* for the app. Each function here creates and returns a DOM element used in the single-page interface of the Uber-like ride-booking app.

All functions are **pure JS UI components** that can be imported and inserted into the main page as needed.

---

## ‚úÖ Purpose

The `views` folder is for **modular, reusable UI components**. These help keep presentation logic separate from business logic and state management.
