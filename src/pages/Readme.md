> **These are the main logic files of the app.**
#### homepage.js

- Initializes map view, search boxes, and event listeners.
- Coordinates calls to other modules for searching, routing, displaying drivers, and payment.

---

#### mapPage.js
- Initializes the Leaflet map.
- Exports the map instance.
- Sets up tile layers and initial view settings.

### handelEvent.js
Handles **all user events**:

- Search button clicks
- Driver selection
- Filter button clicks
- Payment modal events

Acts as a **controller** that wires up UI events to the business logic layer.  
Coordinates between user interactions and calls to functions in `handelRequest.js`, `filterDrivers.js`, `paymentProcess.js`, and the views.

### filterDrivers.js
Provides **functions to sort and filter** the driver list:

- Supports sorting by price or rating
- Returns new sorted arrays for rendering in the UI




### errorPage.js
Handles **displaying error messages** across the app in a consistent way.

- Centralized error UI logic in one module.
- Makes it easy for other modules to show standardized error boxes.
- Ensures users see clear, uniform messages when something goes wrong.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (Flow)

A high-level overview of how the app works step by step:

1Ô∏è‚É£ User enters **pickup** and **destination** addresses in the search boxes.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Autocomplete suggestions appear (powered by **Nominatim**).  
3Ô∏è‚É£ User clicks the **Search** button.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ App fetches the route using **OpenRouteService** and displays it on the **Leaflet** map.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ App loads drivers from **Drivers.json**, assigning simulated distances and prices.  
6Ô∏è‚É£ The **driver list** is displayed in the UI.  
7Ô∏è‚É£ User can **filter** drivers by **price** or **rating**.  
8Ô∏è‚É£ User selects a driver ‚Üí **payment modal** opens.  
9Ô∏è‚É£ Payment process simulates delay ‚Üí shows **success message**.

## üöÄ Setup & Usage

To run the app locally:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Serve** the app with a local development server:

- Recommended tools:
  - [`live-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server)


2Ô∏è‚É£ In `handelRequest.js`, replace:

```js
